# Planning

Main aspects:
1. Organization
	- intuitive URLs and site navigation
	- intuitive exporting feature
	- database and file storage
2. Playback
	- intuitive UI for using the playback system
	- mute/volume settings
		- basic: adjust individual singers
		- higher level: put singers in sections, adjust sections and individuals
		- advanced: singers can switch sections within the same song
	- audio engineering aspect
		1. mixing (combining audio files; may have different sample rates)
		2. noise reduction (getting noise profile from 5s silence; inverting; subtracting)
	- Visual aspect of recordings
		- basic: just song name and duration/current position, as a simple line or as audio waves
		- higher level: animations and annotations by director (ex: "breathe")
		- advanced: video in sync with audio for director or for all singers
3. Recording
	- intuitive UI for using the recording system
	- 5 second silence
	- in sync with playback
		- unless first recording, by director
	- accept or reject
	- overwriting files (requires user database)
