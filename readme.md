## Primary objective
To provide a tool that makes audio mixing so effortless that choirs and ensembles can hear one another rehearse virtually every week

## Members
Andrew, Anna, Connor, Lillie "Henry", Maxine, others to come hopefully <3

### Areas of interest/expertise covered:
- Market research
- UI design
- Sound editing
- Signal processing
- Developers
- Project management

### Areas lacking:
- Project design
- Customer representative
- Senior developers
- More folks with experience
- More folks with interest

## Further notes...

- Two overarching directions this could go in is as a tool for use by established choirs or as a social media platform for use by individuals who want to discover, join, and create groups entirely on the platform. Currently, we're interested in only the tool use.
